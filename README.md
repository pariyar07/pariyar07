# Satyam Pariyar

Senior Software Engineer building reliable, scalable systems across backend, infrastructure, and frontend.

I focus on designing and shipping end-to-end products — from APIs and distributed systems to developer-friendly UIs — with an emphasis on correctness, performance, and long-term maintainability.

- **Backend & Systems**: APIs, service architecture, data modeling, performance tuning  
- **Infrastructure & DevOps**: cloud deployments, CI/CD, observability, reliability  
- **Frontend**: modern React/Next.js applications with strong UX and state discipline  
- **AI & Automation**: integrating AI capabilities into real production workflows

### Tech I use regularly
**Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Backend**: Node.js, REST, event-driven systems  
**Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind
